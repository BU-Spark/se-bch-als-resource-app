## Getting Started

## ALS Resource App

### Project Description

People with ALS around the world are not offered a variety of clinical options. There are dozens of opportunities for what could be the most beneficial option to them, but are usually only offered a few. The goal is to take clinical decision making and turn it into a tool that allows ALS patients to look at options and discuss them with their clinician (I have questions about a, b, and c). This tool/guide will allow people with ALS and clinicians/clinics to collaborate in the process of identifying best options throughout the disease process. Tools, resources, and methodologies are continually evolving to help people with ALS to cope with their condition. Because of the rapid nature of development(s), communicating updated resources to both clinicians and patients is difficult.

The two primary users of this application (mobile or web app) would be patients with ALS or clinicians who work with ALS patients on occasion (such as primary care physicians etc). The goal would be to provide them with a guided system that is constantly updated with the latest information. Each answer to a question or series of questions would lead the user down a different branch of questions and finally suggestions for the patient's current condition. The end goal would be creating a platform that helps distribute the information to patients and clinicians who might not have access to clinics with ALS experts.

### User Stories

As a patient, I want to have the most up-to-date solutions for questions I may have so that I can be sure I am receiving relevant and researched treatments.

As a clinician, I want to have the most up-to-date solutions for questions so that I am giving the proper treatment for my clients' problems.

As a patient, I want to be able to save the resources and articles Iâ€™m recommended in the application so that I can access them at a future date.

As an admin, I want to be able to edit the ordering of questions along with the content in an intuitive and easy manner so that I can manage the application

### Run Project

Backend is hosted on Typeform.

## Getting Started

### Architecture

Here is the Spring 2024 Midterm [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14D7LLQVyJqyRsZOZrKRtz57jpahWUS9vqxkEOyitveg/edit?usp=sharing) that go over the project.

Below is a screenshot of the OLD architecture using Strapi. Please see the README is old-backend-strapi for more details.

Below is a screenshot of the NEW architecture using Typeform.

### Files

To modify components you can go to /src/components. Details for the components, constants,
images and styles are in the ComponentDocs.md files.

### Pages and Utils

To understand the utils, Typeform API, and pages, naviagte to the the Pages&UtilsDocs.md file in src.

### Extendability

1. Database: The code for storing the data in a database (for this code it is mongodb) has been provided. Since it was not required to do so for our project, we did not do so but for future teams, they can modify this code data storage.

2. Deployment on cloud: The application can easily be deployed on a cloud provider. The tests help users see if the code breaks or not. During the semester, we hosted our test versions for the client on Vercel, which provides automatic CI/CD

3. Code modification: We have written modular code written, dividing code into components and classes. Furthermore, detailed explanations for each class can be provided below and on the application.

Below is a detailed explanation of components and pages, which can also be found in their respective READMEs.

### Components

Below is the file structure of the components. Most components rely on global styles, which are available in the utils folder. Most components also require additional static styling, which is including in the .css files in the same sub-directory. Some components, like Title require dynamic styling, which is instead created using mantine in a .tsx file.

            - Renders the CopyableLink component with the generated JSON for easy copying
            - Conditionally displays the CopyableLink component only when generatedJson has content
        * Temporary resolution
            - This is our temporary solution for allowing the client to add videos in Typeform
            - Putting in a title and URL correctly formats the object needed in Typeform to render a video
            - This is a temporary solution in lieu of a custom backend that can handle this more cleanly
            - Typeform is also limited to one video per page, which is another reason a custom backend is needed

### Utils
    * apiUtils.tsx
        * getYouTubeEmbedUrl
            - Returns the YouTube embed URL for a given YouTube video either in short form or long form.

### Tests

Docs Written by @jacob-stein1, contact for assistance
DOCUMENTATION

We have written test cases to check the rendering of components, the function of contexts, and more. Testing is written using the Jest JavaScript testing framework. See their [documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for more info.

Tests are contained within a '**tests**' directory within each sub-directory of the project. For example /pages/**tests**/'page'.test.js contains the test cases for each page in the pages directory.

To run all tests:

$ npm run test

### Recommended Next Steps

- Currently only data for the communication branch is contained in Typeform. Moving the rest of the data from the Figma drawing, or from the client, would be a good step before setting up the next branches.
- QuestionnairePage is a placeholder for making dynamic routing for the four main routes. We recommend using Nextjs dynamic routing to make [id].tsx where id is the four main branches. You can see the dev branch, which is Fall 2023's branch, where they partially implemented dynamic routing.
- Typeform is a temporary solution. We were advised to make a full custom backend using ReactFlow, but we did not have enough time to make it this semester. Implementing a custom backend using Typeform-esque logic will overcome problems like only being able to render one video at a time

We have included each of these next steps and new features as an issue. Please seem them at this [link](https://github.com/BU-Spark/se-bch-als-resource-app/issues)

### Deployment

We deployed the frontend in [vercel](https://se-bch-als-resource-app-zeta.vercel.app/)
Please note the deployed link does not work on the BU Network for some reason.

The data is hosted on Typeform on the buspark@bu.edu account. The api calls to typeform are handled in /api/retrieveQuestions

You can contact Jacob at jmstein@bu.edu for information if you need.
